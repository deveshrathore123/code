Lab 3 
Aim: Use of iptables in linux to create firewalls. 
Objectives: To study how to create and destroy firewall security parameters. 
Outcomes: The learner will be able to:- 
• Recognize the need for having a security on host side by controlling incoming /
 outgoing traffic using the acquired skills and knowledge.
 • Design rules for the INPUT/OUTPUT/FORWARD chain.
 Hardware / Software Required: Linux 
Theory: 
IPtables are the tables provided by the Linux kernel firewall (implemented as different 
Netfilter modules) and the chains and rules it stores. Different kernel modules and programs 
are currently used for different protocols; iptables applies to IPv4, ip6tables to IPv6, arptables 
to ARP, and ebtables to Ethernet frames. 
iptables requires elevated privileges to operate and must be executed by user root, otherwise 
it fails to function. On most Linux systems, iptables is installed as /usr/sbin/iptables and 
documented in its man pages which can be opened using man iptables when installed. It may 
also be found in /sbin/iptables, but since iptables is more like a service rather than an 
"essential binary", the preferred location remains /usr/sbin. 
1. To drop all traffic:
 # 
# 
# 
# 
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP 
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT DROP 
sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP 
sudo iptables -L -v –n 
2. Only Block Incoming Traffic
 To drop all incoming / forwarded packets, but allow outgoing traffic, 
# 
# 
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP 
sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP

# 
# 
# 
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT 
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT 
sudo iptables -L -v –n 
3. Block Outgoing IPaddress host -t a hostname
 sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d outgoing ipaddress -j DROP 
4. Block or Allow ICMP ping request
 sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP/ACCEPT 
Conclusion: 
There are many other firewall utilities and some that may be easier, but iptables is a good 
learning tool, if only because it exposes some of the underlying netfilter structure and because 
it is present in so many systems.
