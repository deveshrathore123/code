## Part 1: General Cryptography Questions (25%)

### Q1. Vigenère Cipher Encryption (5 Marks)

* **Plaintext**: AliRehman
* **Key**: Lahore
* **Tool Used**: Python Script

**Steps & Implementation**:

1. Converted both key and plaintext to lowercase.
2. Used Python script to repeat the key and apply Vigenère formula.
3. Encrypted using formula: `E(pi, ki) = (pi + ki) mod 26`

**Screenshots**:

* Screenshot 1: Terminal input of name and key
* Screenshot 2: Python script output showing encrypted text
* Screenshot 3: Vigenère table reference (optional)

**Explanation**:
Vigenère cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses multiple Caesar shifts based on a repeating keyword.

### Q2. Playfair Cipher Encryption (5 Marks)

* **Plaintext**: THIS IS A MESSAGE
* **Key**: AliRehman

**Steps**:

1. Remove spaces and convert to uppercase.
2. Generate 5x5 matrix excluding 'J'.
3. Break into digraphs (e.g., TH, IS, IS, AM, ES, SA, GE).
4. Apply Playfair rules based on matrix position.

**Screenshots**:

* Screenshot 4: Matrix generated from key
* Screenshot 5: Digraphs processing step
* Screenshot 6: Final encrypted output

**Explanation**:
Digraphs are encrypted using position-based rules: same row/column or rectangle rule.

### Q3. Three RSA Use Cases at Teesside (5 Marks)

**Use Cases**:

1. Student emails encrypted using public key
2. Secure login using asymmetric keys
3. Digital signatures on assignments

**Screenshot 7**: Diagram showing key pair usage in email, login, and signatures.

### Q4. Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication (5 Marks)

**RSA Usage**:

* **Confidentiality**: Encrypt with recipient's public key
* **Integrity**: Use hashing and encryption
* **Authentication**: Sender encrypts with their private key

**Screenshot 8**: Diagram showing public/private key usage for all three.

### Q5. Diffie-Hellman with 3 Parties (5 Marks)

**Steps**:

1. Public prime `p` and base `g` shared
2. Alice, Bob, Carol pick private keys (a, b, c)
3. Share g^a, g^b, g^c mod p
4. Combine in sequence to derive same shared secret

## Part 2: Security Analysis (75%)

### Scenario 1: Bell-LaPadula Model (20 Marks)

**Subjects**: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines
**Objects**: Documents
**Security Levels**: Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, Unclassified

**Rules**:

* No Read Up (NRU): Low clearance can't read higher documents
* No Write Down (NWD): High clearance can't write to lower levels

**Screenshots**:

* Screenshot 11: Lattice of levels
* Screenshot 12: Access control matrix
* Screenshot 13: Policy model diagram

**Explanation**:
Ensures strict confidentiality, preventing data leaks across security boundaries.
